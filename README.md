# High Fidelity Tools

This is a collection of tools for High Fidelity to make the process of creating scripts easier.

## Build

```
npx hifi-tools build ./myscript.js
```

The Build tool converts and packages your code so that it can be used in High Fidelity. This lets you use ES6+ features
which are not yet available natively in High Fidelity.
